# UNIX-Lab8
This repository will be used for students to show their forking, branching and PRs practice.

Our common project is to write Quiz#2. The format should be similar to Quiz#1: True-and-False, multiple choice and short-answer questions. There should be one text file per question type. 

Please add as many questions as you few inspired! They might make their way into the real quiz ;-)
